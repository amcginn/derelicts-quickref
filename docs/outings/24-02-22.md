> If they have found the ruins under the fortress, they will have access to the shielding system I created. In that case you’ll need to find the secret entrance to the well cavern. If you have seen the bridge that was destroyed when they fired upon me, you’ll see a passage in the wall that leads to a set of barrels. The furthest barrel is an illusion I created and will reveal a ladder down to the well passage. Within that, the wall on your left will have a patch of heavy moss. Whisper the words, _“Zellah Grazia”_ to open the secret passage. The family should be there, because it’s the only place I wasn’t able to get to before getting struck down. They might have been overtaken down there as well. Regardless. Within that room there’s a stone tablet at the center. You can speak to the stone at the center to turn on and off the shield. The words _“Ovonzell”_ will turn it on and shift the energy around it to blue. The word _“Korenzeel”_ will turn it off and the energy surrounding it will shift to red.
