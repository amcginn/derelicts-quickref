* blood

### Myra

wis: 19
- there's an earthy smell; feels and smells <fiioria>FiiOria</fiioria>, a druid friend, nearby. <myra>Myra</myra> learned how to transform from her, so she is very familiar with her
  - shouts "I smell a dirty hippie"


(note: can use **Favored Enemy** to sense a specific enemy—undead)

* <reece>Reece</reece>: we don't want trouble, but attacked by green, slimy frog thing. it went east (west?) after we hit it twice. take care of it and we'll sort it out

### Nepnik

**Dash** to move into small building. another house that had been well taken care of

### Myra

when <fiioria>FiiOria</fiioria> is injured, can eat wildlife and regain health (hence dead chickens)

used instruction from <mogli>Mogli</mogli> to gain more movement (inspiration)

### Gróa

- movement on main building is gone

### Nepnik

uses inspiration and **Dash** (120ft total)

calls out if someone can hear that he sees footprints (<mogli>Mogli</mogli> knows something is going on...)

hears zombie RIGHT NEXT TO HIM

### Myra

<myra>Myra</myra> said don't kill it
