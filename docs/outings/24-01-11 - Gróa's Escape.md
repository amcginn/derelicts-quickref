# No Escaping Fate

<groa>Gróa</groa> and _Saga_ are being tracked by the _White Blades_ while they are fleeing through a canyon to <location>Solaris</location> to find sanctuary at the <location>Solar Cathedral</location>—the cathedral of the gods.

## Solaris Pass

Suddenly, they hear whistling from someone out of sight behind them. They hear footsteps and quickly turn around to see a man appear.

"What do we have here?" He is wearing the garb of a _White Blade elite_. Amused, he calls out, "Seems a few lizard Sorcerers have slithered into the solar pass." They then hear rustling on the cliffs around them and notice several _White Blade archers_. The two Dragonborn could likely take these archers and have a fight with the elite, but something felt off. If they attack him, he'll know he's right, and they can't take that risk, so they decide to turn back around and continue toward the city. When they do, the elite repeats the same whistle as before, and the archers move to attack.

"Let 'em fly, boys."

_Saga_ mutters something and a shining aura appears around <groa>Gróa</groa>. She immediately feels the protection of **Golgazia's Shield** and knows this was no ordinary spell. <groa>Gróa</groa> was taken aback; "Wait, did I hear her say 'please?'"

When <groa>Gróa</groa> cast a spell at the elite, he suddenly appeared across the stream on the other shore. This was out of her spell range, and they knew they had to try to escape.

All of the archers started attacking, and, though <groa>Gróa</groa> wasn't being hit because of the shield's protection, _Saga_ quickly took damage. They continued their escape toward the city while throwing **Witch Bolt** spells at the archers. Another elite appears on the cliffs ahead, and it now becomes a race to get out alive.

The archers seemed to notice that <groa>Gróa</groa> was taking very little damage, so they focused their attacks on _Saga_. She was bleeding heavily, so <groa>Gróa</groa> stopped a moment for a concentrated attack while _Saga_ healed herself. <groa>Gróa</groa> knew nothing she did would be able to heal _Saga_ enough, so all she could do was try to distract and destroy the enemy.

_Saga_ grabbed <groa>Gróa</groa>'s arm and said, "we can't fight them anymore. We have to get to safety. To the cathedral." They both **Dash**ed away, only to be met with the first White Blade elite and more archers. _Saga_ pushed <groa>Gróa</groa> against the cliff's face to be out of sight of some of the archers, but there wasn't enough room for both of them. Before they were able to move again, _Saga_ was hit again. This time, the elite didn't even bother with <groa>Gróa</groa>.

With what looked like might be her last steps, _Saga_ pushed off against <groa>Gróa</groa> and yelled, "run for it!" In <groa>Gróa</groa>'s hesitated concern, she watched _Saga_ turn around the last bend of the valley and disappear toward the city. <groa>Gróa</groa> was about to cause a distraction and delay for the archers, but she noticed a moment's chance of no volley of arrows and **Dash**ed after _Saga_.

## Solaris

When <groa>Gróa</groa> entered the city gates, she saw _Saga_ rounding a corner ahead. <groa>Gróa</groa> knew there were eyes and ears around that could not be trusted, so she couldn't call out but hastened to catch up to _Saga_.

She got to the corner and could not see where _Saga_ went. There were a few people around, a couple city guards across the courtyard, and a large—no, large wasn't even enough to describe this Emperian—but friendly, merchant selling what he was loudly claiming to be the exact enchanted items that a passerby needed. <groa>Gróa</groa>'s eyes were darting around for a glimpse of _Saga_ and the item in the merchant's hand caught her eye. For the convincing way he was talking, she thought it would be fairly uncommon, charmed jewelry, but it was an ordinary mask. Someone had cast something on it, but it could hardly be called enchanted, and it definitely wouldn't do what he was claiming. As <groa>Gróa</groa> finally saw _Saga_ and chased after her down the street, she heard the merchant; "It's the only mask like this I've procured in quite a while! You are very lucky that you happened by here today, as this mask will charm her family quite well! They will assuredly approve of the marriage then!"

## Solar Cathedral

### Discovered

<groa>Gróa</groa> entered the cathedral to find _Saga_ weakly walking toward the center of the great hall. As she steps forward, <groa>Gróa</groa> feels the energy of the shield dissipate and the shine fade. 

A robed, portly human approaches, "How can I help you?"

"We require sanctuary."

He clearly notices the blood running from _Saga_'s wounds. "From?"

She merely answers, "The world."

He eyes both of them and his eyes settle on the focus in _Saga_'s hand. "This is a refuge for those who follow the gods. Sorcerers don't get their magic from the gods."

Impatiently, <groa>Gróa</groa> answers, "The gods would provide sanctuary for any creature in need!"

Affronted, the elder retorts, "I cannot grant you sanctuary here. Please leave now."

"We have nowhere to go," _Saga_ says. "We follow the gods whether our magic comes directly from them or not. The argument could be made that our magic did come from the gods upon our creation. We just don't require their focus to maintain its flow."

He sighs deeply and motions for them to wait there. "I'll need to discuss this with an Elder. For now, sit tight."

Turning to <groa>Gróa</groa>, _Saga_ said, "we should check that we are alone and safe here. I will search here, and you can search upstairs, but first -" She reached into her bag and pulled out a spell pocket, not unlike her own. "You've recently shown me that you are ready to weild this, and I finally found one here that I wanted for you." Before <groa>Gróa</groa> could equip the pocket or even say anything, _Saga_ continued. "As we have trained, it has become clear to me that this staff is meant to be yours."

<groa>Gróa</groa> started, "No, that's-"

Cutting her off, _Saga_ continued, "I heard there was a merchant here who had a staff that would be a better fit for me, anyway." A knot grew in <groa>Gróa</groa>'s stomach—that merchant outside is probably just going to give her a walking stick. Pulling her ring off, _Saga_ hands it to <groa>Gróa</groa>, "And I want you to have this so that-"

"On my command, we enter and take them both!" a voice bellows from outside. They can hear guards from each side of the cathedral.

"Upstairs! GO! NOW!"
"I can help you here," <groa>Gróa</groa> pleads.
"Have you not learned by now to trust me??"

Slightly hurt, but reassured in her mentor, <groa>Gróa</groa> obeys and rushes upstairs. As she shoves on the ring, she mutters to herself, "I don't know what your plan is, but I'm still going to do what I can to help you." She thought she felt the ring twist as she clenched her fist.

Getting up the steps and glancing over the railing to _Saga_ below, she hears the doors burst open and several armored bodies rushing in. 

"We were told there were two of you! Where's your little friend?" <groa>Gróa</groa> realizes these aren't the city guard she saw, but the White Blades finally caught up to them.

"She went to find food," _Saga_ replied. "She'll be back soon with-"

"Why is she still alive?!" the voice from the canyon interrupts. "Don’t talk to her. Just kill her!"

"This is the <location>Solar Cathedral</location>, sir. This is the house of the gods."

"And?"

"We’ll incur the wrath of the gods if we kill them in here."

"There is no need to kill my servant. She is nothing. I am the sorcerer, not her. She was simply helping me find refuge." _Saga_ gestures at the building they were in. "As for me, I came to the Solar Cathedral for I heard all may find sanctuary here under the laws of our land."

"Dragonborn don’t adhere to the laws of our land."

"That’s often true, but the laws remain all the same."

"Not for your kind. Not for those who aided in the cataclysm."

"That was the Necromancers and Druids, not us."

Laughter erupts from below. "Dragonborn killed many of my friends during the war. Killed their friends too." Mutterings of agreement flow from those below.

"I abhorred the war. Too much blood was shed on both sides." She gestures between she and the voice. "This is a time of peace between our people."

"Forced peace, maybe." He steps into view. "But I don’t feel terribly peaceful today. How ‘bout you, fellas?" Mutters of similar anger erupt.

"So be it." Fire erupts from around her. Bolts are let loose from their crossbows, piercing through her scales and the spell dissipates instantaneously. 

"Do you like that? Those bolts in your body are made from an ore we mined from a local cavern." He taps one of the bolts. "It disrupts the flow of magic in those who don’t channel their magic from the gods." 

_Saga_ drops to a knee. "You won’t get away with this. The gods have seen what you’ve done here."

"I don’t hear them knocking down the walls, lizard." He turns to leave and laughs. "Do what you wish, fellas. She won’t be able to stop you, now."

### Golgazia's wrath

Shocked and not knowing what to do, <groa>Gróa</groa> is wringing her hands in fear and anticipation—it's only a matter of time before they find her, too. She feels the ring moving once more and glances down. The engraved dragon begins to unravel.

Golgazia appears beside her, staring down at _Saga_. His eyes are full of rage and he yells, "My love!"

_Saga_ glances upward, smiling through the pain. "Take care of <groa>Gróa</groa>." More bolts are let loose into _Saga_ and some are aimed up at Golgazia.

He bats them aside. "Raaaaaggghhhhhh!" Lava floods the floor below killing everyone instantly. The lava rises until it reaches just below the level they are standing on. The heat is smothering and <groa>Gróa</groa> winces in pain (taking 1d6 every minute).

"You need to get out of here, child," _Golgazia_ bellows. "Go through that window there and descend." He touches her on the forehead and she feels suddenly as light as a feather. "Go now." He fades from view and the dragon curls back around the ring.

## The hiding place

Once outside the window, <groa>Gróa</groa> realizes that there is no easy way down. She glances around to find the streets nearly deserted and no city guard in sight. From this balcony, the ground is too far down, but there is a roof down a story. She crawls over the railing and as she is letting herself down, her foot slips, but without any effort, she lands softly on the roof. Too rushed to consider it, she moves along to find the easiest way down. As she nears the corner with the merchant, she realizes it is likely too far to jump safely, but she may be able to use a tree to help herself down. It's far to get to, but it seems she has no choice. 

As she is readying herself, she hears, "Now that was a fancy fall!" The merchant's lighthearted tone feels so out of place after what <groa>Gróa</groa> just went through, but there he is, beaming up at her.

Of course! He was large enough that if he helped her, she shouldn't have any problem getting down. "Can you help me down? Quickly, if you can."

"With what I just saw, you don't need any help, but sure, I'll catch you! Jump on down!" Without any other option, she jumps and quickly finds herself on the ground. "Haha! See! I barely had to touch you!" <groa>Gróa</groa>'s eyes dart down the street and back up to the window of the cathedral, which is now closed, though no one followed her out. They then hear heavy footsteps and armor coming up the stairs from down the street.

With a glint in his eyes, the merchant looks back at her. "Say, you look like someone who might need a cloak of invisibility. Or perhaps this mask that has the power to charm even the likes of the Succubi and Incubi from the gates of the inferno."

They hear shouting from the _White Blades_, and he realizes who is pursuing her. His jovial face shifts to hatred. 

"Take this." He reaches into his booth and opens a small box and places a necklace in her hand. "Hide inside."

The moment <groa>Gróa</groa> takes the necklace, she feels her magic instantly muted. Is this what the White Blade mentioned? Is this how _Saga_ felt as she died?

"I know what you’re feeling right now likely makes you trust me all the less, but you need to hide inside. They can’t sense you if your magic is nulled."

Without much choice and suddenly no energy to fight it, she slips inside. As she closes the door, the merchant covertly shifts his booth until he completely blocks the door.

She hears the group of _White Blades_ approaching, and that same voice from before gets her attention. "Have you seen a dragonborn leave the Cathedral?"

The severe tone gone, he replied, "Well, I saw someone scurrying along the roof there but couldn’t make him out."

"The lizard was a female."

"I’m afraid there wasn’t any way of telling her sex from here. Just that she was in a hurry as she scampered about." He laughs heartily. "Must have scared her near to death for her to run about like the Squirrels, eh." He slaps the man on the chest. "Am I right?"

"Don’t touch me!"

"I’m terribly sorry." He backs away. "Can I interest you in this mask? Legend has it, if you ask it face to face where someone or something is, it’ll tell you which direction to go!"

"I’m not interested in any of your trash," the man says. "If you happen to locate the lizard, contact the White Blades and we’ll take care of her. She is armed and dangerous. Do not attempt to restrain her yourself."

They moved on, but <groa>Gróa</groa> could still hear them nearby. Feeling safe to breathe again, she glanced around to see boxes of the "unique" masks the merchant was selling. Around the room, there are a few trinkets that stand out, but everything else is worthless. The door opens, and she notices that the voices had faded.

After a tense moment, he asked, "Armed and dangerous, huh? Is that so??"

"When I need to be." She glanced at a small box of cooking knives (the note reads "Adds flavor!") and then at the door.

"Ha ha ha! No need to be in here!" he suddenly roared with laughter. "I'm _Whitaker_, and this is my little shop here in <location>Solaris</location>. Truth is, the _White Blades_ wanted a license to murder without consequence and they got it. Before their symbol was that of the white blade, it was a decapitated dragonborn head. They accept whatever symbol or cause allows them to murder with impunity."

"Look around you." He locks up the shop. "90% of these trinkets have no magical properties at all—whatsoever." He leans back on a counter and opens a panel in the wall. "But these here are truly powerful relics. In order to track down the rarest items, I have to sell crap for as much as I can and buy enchanted items for cheap."

He pointed at <groa>Gróa</groa>'s neck. "That necklace allows me to dampen the magical properties of what people come to sell me. It makes them look like they’ve been used up. I buy them for a steal, and they go in this pocket on the wall." He smirked.

"You might be asking yourself why I’m trusting you with this information. It could truly destroy my business if it got out. I have given you my trust. You know where my most valuable items are and how I’ve acquired many of them." He nods his head to the side.

"Understanding this, might you gift me even a fraction of your trust? If it would help, further, to encourage you not to go back out there, might I offer you a job? As I’ve admitted, most of this is junk. Nothing magical or enchanted about them."

He gets glint in his eye. "But with you at my side, they might appear to have a little something more to them. What do you say?" He reaches out his hand for her to shake.

She glances down, thinking, "what a distasteful, Emperian custom. Those trinkets show how he doesn't just deal with locals. Surely he knows better." Looking up again, she notices that, for the first time, he has a sincere, friendly look on his face. She then understands that this is the first sign of trust, because he knows that if she is willing to shake hands, it is going to be the start of a great partnership.

<groa>Gróa</groa> reaches out and grasps his hand and says, "alright, my name is <groa>Gróa</groa>. I'm in."
