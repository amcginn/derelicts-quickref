      "bio": "<h2 dir=\"ltr\">~ Exile - A Dark Universe ~</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elrick stepped up to the portal and brought his Time Lord mask down over his face. A stream of coordinates and dates ran across the screen in front of his eyes. He winked to lock them in and the words Verrouillage: L'Univers Seripharadis ran bold across his vision. There was a whirring and a pop as the portal before him shifted to show open space with stars twinkling.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There was something off about that twinkling. Something twisted. He squinted to study the universe before him. It was darker than before, several stars had shifted in their position, and an overwhelming thrumming pulsed against his mask.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before he could step through to investigate, the voice of Lavoisier, Master of Time, called out, &ldquo;Where you off to?&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elrick waved a dismissive hand, replying, &ldquo;After documenting Cthulhu ripping apart another universe, I need a vacation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not our way.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I need a minute to get my head straight.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take long,&rdquo; Lavoisier urged. &ldquo;Cthulhu is on the move. I&rsquo;ll need you to document the destruction left in his wake. Hopefully, by the time you get back, I&rsquo;ll have a lock on the date and universe he's resurfaced in.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elrick&rsquo;s head dropped and shook. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t watch another universe fall to him. Find someone else.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a request.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;It never is,&rdquo; Elrick whispered into the mask.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lavoisier could be heard quickly approaching. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, what was that?&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elrick lifted his head when a warning flashed before his eyes stating the portal would soon close. He turned to look at Lavoisier, waved with two fingers, and dropped backward into the open space of Seripharadis, the origin universe of the Time Lords.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once through, Elrick&rsquo;s eyes adjusted to see what had broken. Seriph, the star that was once an ancient dragon of time, had twisted in on itself. The beloved star that had given birth to all Time Lords was now turned inside out, pulling other stars into its vacuous embrace. He could feel its touch gripping at his suit and tugging. He was far enough away that there wasn't any real danger to him yet, but soon that may no longer be the case.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before he could turn back, something shifted within the blackhole. No&hellip; That&rsquo;s not quite right. Whatever it was, floated between the blackhole and Elrick.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With a terrible shock, he realized what it was and glared at the monstrous god, so nearly, perfectly camouflaged against the spiraling black that had replaced Seriph.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Cthulhu.&rdquo; The name fell out of him in the form of a vile curse.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Upon speaking it, though the elder god appeared too far off to hear, a tentacle on the monster&rsquo;s head twitched and the titan glanced ever so slowly back at Elrick. Bright, red eyes pierced through Elrick&rsquo;s mask and into his soul.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The words &lsquo;welcome, Time Lord&rsquo; erupted in Erlick&rsquo;s mind, followed by a pulsating, thrumming that made him nearly rip the mask away to take pressure off his head.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elrick winked and the screen before his eyes lit up with a command prompt that read: Input Destination. He thought of the Time Lord Library as he&rsquo;d left it. The coordinates ran across the screen. He winked and the words Verrouillage: Biblioth&egrave;que de Temps ran bold across the screen.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When the screen dimmed, floating directly outside his mask was the colossal visage of Cthulhu. A wicked smile spread across the elder gods face as evil eyes watched a portal flash and open.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;NO!&rdquo; Elrick screamed.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cthulhu let out a deep, pulsating chortle and replied both in Elrick&rsquo;s mind and out loud into the Seripharadis universe with a low, prolonged, vibrating, &ldquo;Yyyeeesss.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elrick winked and the screen reappeared. An attempt to send the mental command FORCE CANCEL was battered down and mauled to shreds by a sudden, intense thrumming. Blood ran from Elrick&rsquo;s nose as the display flickered and went dark. Something pinched him around the middle and, within the sea of black, pain sprouted along his spine, blossomed at the back of his neck, and branched across his ribs. Coughing followed by a wheezing escaped as air was crushed from his lungs. Red splattered across the lens of his mask driving home the imminent realization that he was out of time and would soon cease to exist. He slammed his palms against whatever was piercing his suit and closed his eyes to muster as much focus as possible to absorb time from Cthulhu.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The word &lsquo;Pathetic&rsquo; was spat into the back of Elrick&rsquo;s mind followed by a rushing motion as his body was hurled through space toward the blackhole. The contents of his stomach joined the blood on his lens and a hissing could be heard. A horrific truth clawed through his gut to crawl coldly up to strangle all other thought: The suit that protected him within the dead of open space was rapidly emptying itself of the gasses and fluids that sustained him.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Something bright blurred beyond the smears staining the lens of his mask. A few seconds passed and there was a lightning blast of blue. And, then, the blurry mirage of a radiant blue dragon stretching wide its wings filled the lens from left to right. He closed his eyes, believing it would soon blind him, only to see the image burnt into the back of his eyelids.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Something wrapped around his fist, and he felt his trajectory swiftly twist and shift back the way he had come. Within little more than an instant, he felt the familiar static of passing through a portal and then his chest made rough contact with a solid floor.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Certain Cthulhu was toying with him, he tried to grab whatever was wrapped around his fist. It gracefully crossed from one hand to wrap around the opposite. Something else grabbed him around the shoulders and he felt himself being dragged across the floor. The sound of an emergency door seal slamming down and locking tight could be heard behind him and then light erupted when his mask was pulled off.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lavoisier stood over him, attempting to clean the mask out with his bare hand. &ldquo;I thought you were dead.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elrick put a hand to his stomach where he&rsquo;d been pierced. &ldquo;I think I might be.&rdquo; His hand came away smattered in blood. Then the nightmare replayed in his head. &ldquo;Cthulhu!&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Yes, we must beat him to the Library.&rdquo; Lavoisier stopped and narrowed his eyes at Elrick&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elrick&rsquo;s eyes went wide and he glanced sideways at a small, black dragon. Blue energy pulsed through its wings, chest, mouth, and eyes as the creature&rsquo;s head tilted from side to side to study them in return.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I think this little guy saved my life,&rdquo; Elrick said.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Looks to be a girl,&rdquo; Lavoisier corrected. &ldquo;But we can talk about all that later. We have work to do.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elrick jolted when he heard an explosion. &ldquo;Cthulhu is attacking us.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Yes. Please do try to keep up.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Our people!&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;They can only follow after the Library.&rdquo; Lavoisier handed the mask back to Elrick as he helped him to his feet. &ldquo;Therefore, moving the Library to a new universe is our priority.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The dragon watched the window as something orange and blazing whizzed by outside. Elrick followed the creature&rsquo;s gaze to see Cthulhu launching from one star ship to another, tearing gaping holes through starship hulls. Time Lords were floating through open space without suits on.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;They never had a chance. This is my fault and they&rsquo;re all going to die if we don&rsquo;t do something.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Their lives may be lost,&rdquo; Lavoisier admitted, &ldquo;But they&rsquo;ll truly be lost forever if we don&rsquo;t save the Library. Through the Library, their names will live on for all eternity.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wake up, Lavoisier. Our people are out there choking to death on the vacuum of space. We must return fire.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have any military vessels, Elrick.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;We did this to ourselves.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s who we are.&rdquo; Lavoisier said as he opened a portal. &ldquo;Never interfere. Only document.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Even to save ourselves?&rdquo; Elrick couldn&rsquo;t believe what he was hearing. &ldquo;How could we be so arrogant to think he&rsquo;d never come for us.&rdquo; He watched Lavoisier step through the portal into the Library and sit at the Master of Time&rsquo;s captain seat. &ldquo;Your foolish doctrine is blinding you to what that Library truly is. It&rsquo;s a weapon that sucks life from stars!&rdquo; He limped toward the portal. &ldquo;Turn the siphon on Cthulhu and we could end this here and now.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t use it for that,&rdquo; Lavoisier said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not who we are.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Then we must evolve our thinking!&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Your name will forever be documented in the Library as an honored Time Lord.&rdquo; Lavoisier said, nodding a curt goodbye.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare,&rdquo; Elrick threw out a hand and sent a tendril of time energy to catch the portal.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With a wave, the Master of Time dispelled it.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Coward!&rdquo; Elrick roared as he used what strength he had left to lunge for the portal.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lavoisier held out a palm and a tendril of bright light shot through the portal and into Elrick.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Time slowed to a near stop, yet the dragon tilted her head from side to side as quickly as ever to study the Master of Time through the portal.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lavoisier looked back curiously and then waved a hand.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The portal snapped shut.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elrick&rsquo;s time sped back up to normal and his broken body met the floor with a crash.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A screech of protest came from the dragon as Elrick pulled himself up onto a knee. He sighed, glancing at the creature. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you saved my life to die at my side.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The dragon appeared to shrug in a most adorably nonchalant way while staring curiously at the portal that opened ahead of the massive Time Lord Library starship. She chirped and flapped her wings, yet remained fastened to Elrick&rsquo;s hand.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;If you can get there, little one, you should go.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She chirped again and then looked in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elrick turned to see Cthulhu rushing toward the portal.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I should be upset, but we deserve this.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The dragon made a face that bore the likeness of an angry scolding.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What do you expect this broken body to do against something so powerful?&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She flapped her wings and pointed her face at the monstrosity as he passed by.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Elrick snapped. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll kill you with a look.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The next thing he felt was his arm being pulled out of socket as the little dragon exploded forward in the form of a brilliant, blue beam of time energy. Cthulhu didn&rsquo;t even have a chance to give the look Elrick had mentioned before she pierced through his chest.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Every wrinkle in the elder god&rsquo;s rubbery figure lit up with the same blue energy, his massive, grotesque body stopping abruptly mid-flight.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The starships that remained somewhat intact moved quickly to line up and one by one they began zipping forward and through to the new universe.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The blue that coursed through Cthulhu began to pale and before the final ship could pass through the portal, the monster managed to break free and took chase. The ship was partially through when the portal slammed shut with a cosmic boom, tearing the starship in half.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cthulhu&rsquo;s roar rumbled and the ship Elrick remained in rocked. The elder god took hold of the ship broken by the portal, as a child might a toy boat at bath time, and flung it, with all its dying passengers, deeper into space. He twirled and with a blinding speed approached Elrick.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Slamming his mask back over his head, Elrick tried to enter panicked, mental commands into a flickering screen. &ldquo;Come on, come on, come on.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Erupting in his head were the words, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s have a chat, shall we?&rsquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elrick stopped struggling with the mask and took it off to see a huge, glowing, red eyeball staring through the window at him.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to kill me,&rdquo; said Elrick, &ldquo;get to it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The massive red eye shifted to a dark green with gold speckles. &lsquo;They abandoned you.&rsquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Mice tend to scatter when the cat pounces.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That deep, rumbling, chortle erupted, shaking the ship. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got me there.&rdquo; This time the words were not in his mind and the ship shuddered under the weight of it. The eye shifted to Elrick&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Your friend stopped me cold. Nothing has ever done that before. I'm impressed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elrick felt, more than saw, the dragon reappearing around his hand.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;No reason we can&rsquo;t be friends,&rdquo; Cthulhu mused, &ldquo;you and I.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elrick scoffed at the thought. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be serious?&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I need soldiers like yourself.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The eye appeared to look inside of Elrick. He could feel the layers of his mind and soul being flipped through like pages of a diary.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After perusing the first few chapters the monster grew bored with the story and closed the book. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re angry with your people for letting this happen. For not fighting me sooner.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Infuriated.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Then set your anger with me aside and let us hunt them together.&rdquo; He pulled away from the window far enough to show Elrick his wicked smile. &ldquo;We'll kill that old coward and put you in his throne as the new Master of Time. Then, if you're still mad at me, you can have a go at&ndash;how did your internal story remember it&ndash;turning the siphon on me to end me here and now.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elrick tried to match the smile. &ldquo;Now, that sounds like a story I'd read.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;All in good time, baby mouse.&rdquo; Cthulhu looked Elrick over and waved a talon in a circle. The wounds closed and Elrick was finally able to take a breath.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The dragon appeared appalled by the energy and crawled into Elrick&rsquo;s Time Lord Void Pocket to hide.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cthulhu grabbed the ship Elrick was in and opened a portal of his own, this one dark and menacing. &ldquo;All in good time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It took everything Elrick could muster to steady himself as they rushed through the portal.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once on the other side, massive Eldritch monsters could be seen floating in space, awaiting Cthulhu&rsquo;s return.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite being surrounded by horrors, Elrick couldn't help but smirk as he thought to himself: I&rsquo;m lucky he was too lazy to keep flipping through my pages. Worst mistake he&rsquo;ll ever make.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">~ Derelict ~</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To be revealed&hellip;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
